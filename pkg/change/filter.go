// NewFilter — the zero value is the "no filtering" sentinel and
// returns true from ShouldReconcile for every id.
//
// The keep set has two tiers:
//
//   - "keep" entries reconcile. resolve() seeds this from file
//     changes + ancestors of changed files (#58) + structural
//     parents of owner KSes (#103).
//   - "primary" is the subset whose render output likely differs
//     from baseline: file-change owners, their siblings under the
//     same owner, transitive deps walked from a primary entry, and
//     runtime entries inserted by AddEmitted from a primary
//     emitter. Ancestor-only entries are explicitly NOT primary.
//
// The keep set extends at runtime via AddEmitted when a primary
// parent KS renders and emits a child the file-walk couldn't see
// (kustomize component + replacement patterns generate Flux
// Kustomizations on the fly — see #204). Ancestor-only emitters
// don't propagate keep to file-loaded children, which prevents a
// one-file change from cascading the entire tree into keep.
